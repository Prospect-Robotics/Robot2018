/*
* 
*  Nomenclature:
*  
*  - get/set "target" values -- read the current objective.  If we are going to a position and/or at a 
*    a particular speed, the motor is going to try to use it's closed loop logic to maintain the 
*    speed and/or reach the target position.  It may in fact go up and down in either speed and may
*    overshoot or oscillate on position.  The "target" values are what you told it to try to do.
*    
*  - get/set "current' values -- state read directly from the motor controller on what it is actually
*    doing at this moment.  In some cases we can't actually get up to the moment status on the closed
*    loop behavior, but wherever we can - we will use "current".
*    
*    Talon can give you 'current' position and rate information.  In closed loop modes, depending on 
*    the mode in use, we can often get the closed loop error to determine whether we are going
*    'forward' or 'reverse' at that moment in time.
