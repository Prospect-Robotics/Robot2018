/**
 * AutonomousCommandGroup is a subclass of {@link CommandGroup} with helper methods and a little state

 *
 * Naming Conventions For adding individual Commands:
 *
 * {@literal add<device><action><Async|Sync>}
 *
 * Naming Conventions for adding command sequences:
 *
 * {@literal add<Goal>Sequence<Sync|Async>}
 *
 *     where *Async means that the command doesn't finish what it started and you better make sure it's
 *     done later in your script.
 *     where *Sync means the command is complete before it returns.
