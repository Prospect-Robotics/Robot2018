	 * 
	 * 1.  The PID is controlling a % of maximum output power for rotation, so we have to generate a proportional value that is
	 * much smaller than 1.0 but proportional to direction and magnitude of the error in our current gyroscope angle relative to 
	 * the gyroscope angle when we started.
	 * 
	 * 2.  The goal is to get something that is "just enough" to compensate for the worst case performance anomaly -
	 * in other words - we are dragging on the left right now so the output has to be just strong enough to counter that and no
	 * stronger.  
	 * 
	 * 3.  Without knowing how throttle % and angle % are combined, the current loading and battery level, and the maximum
	 * speed under those conditions - we really can't begin to calculate this value.  Fortunately, we just have to derived it 
	 * empirically and it was pretty easy.  I just increased by .01 until it was tracking to within approximately 
	 * +/- 1 degree through the arc.  
	 * 
	 * 4.  IF the robot gets much worse than it is now, this can be increased but you could always fix the damage.
