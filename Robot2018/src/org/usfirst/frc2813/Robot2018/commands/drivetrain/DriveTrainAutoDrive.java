	 * in other words - we are dragging on the left right now so the output has to be just strong enough to counter that and no
	 * stronger.
	 *
	 * 3.  Without knowing how throttle % and angle % are combined, the current loading and battery level, and the maximum
	 * speed under those conditions - we really can't begin to calculate this value.  Fortunately, we just have to derived it
	 * empirically and it was pretty easy.  I just increased by .01 until it was tracking to within approximately
	 * +/- 1 degree through the arc.
